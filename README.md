## Easy Deployment
If you're ~~artistic~~ less technologically proficient, use these.

Firstly, make sure you have a GitHub account (sign in!). If you don't, make one for free [here](https://github.com/join). Then, scroll to the top of this page, press the blue `Code` button, then the `Codespaces` tab, and then `Create codespace on main`. 

Next, wait for the page to load. Near the bottom of the page will be a terminal. Type in the following:
```
pnpm i
```
Then press enter. Then type in the following:
```
npm run bstart
```
And press enter. You should get a popup, select `Make public`. Next select the `PORTS (1)` tab, hover over the line under `Forwarded Address`, and click the globe icon. That's it.
